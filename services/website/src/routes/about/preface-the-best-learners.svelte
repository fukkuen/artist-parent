		<p>感謝天台塾的邀請為《事件譜之又係藝術家又係阿爸阿媽》一書寫序。在疫情已超過一年
			之際,我作為兩子女之母、藝術家的太太,以及 M+ 的教學策展人,對這命題感受很深。
			過去一年各行各業都為著要「照常營業」而施展渾身解數——老師學生要克服種種困難進
			行網上授課;父母或照顧者無論在家工作與否,難題都接踵而來。我當刻問自己:究竟學
			習的目的是甚麼?現在最需要在家「不停學」的學問又是甚麼?甚至質疑在疫情下,藝術
			教育還重要嗎?</p>

		<p>藝術家未必是最好的學生,卻往往是最好的學習者——他們對世界充滿好奇心,抱持開放
			的態度去觀察事物和敢於發問,並拒絕慣性思考,以創意的方法回應不同的挑戰。因此,
			藝術家對世界的理解常有新的體會,同時因為懂得自我了解和自我肯定令抗逆力也自然提
			升。這讓我想起「流動共學」許寶強談及哲學家海德格對學習與思考的想法:他以木匠作
			例子,指出木匠必須了解不同木材的外在和內在特質,才能把每根獨有木材的最好一面展
			露無遺。正如真正的學習是透過非因循、不斷更新的思維及開放的態度去理解才會發生。</p>

		<p>此計劃的誕生源於西九文化區管理局的「藝術紓困計劃 2020」。參與的藝術家以「指令
			藝術」的創作模式介入子女之間的日常經驗,通過來自生活的觀察,得出千奇百怪的意
			念,讓參與者自由解讀和重新演繹指令,沒有單一的標準答案。作為兩子之母及藝術家的
			太太,我發現爸爸很擅長打破對生活以至學習的預設印象和情感,並視周遭有限條件為學
			習的契機,喚起小朋友對尋常生活的學習動力和興趣,從中跟他們一同學習。吊詭的是,
			看似約束的指令,竟能擺脫現況的種種局限,打開生活的其他可能,最終發現藝術是無處
			不在的。</p>

		<p>我認識天台塾已有一段很長的日子,特別喜歡其實驗性藝術教育項目,當中「學學習」系
			列令我很有共鳴。還記得我為 M+ 博物館策劃教學活動時,才發現學習如何學習,比學習
			更多知識更為重要,特別是作為家長,在忙碌時會容易忘卻求知的熱情。我期待博物館將
			來成為開放的終身學習平台,連結一眾對教育有熱誠的團體,透過不同創意範疇和背境的
			人士參與,大家共同及彼此學習,活到老學到老。</p>

		<p>疫情會過,但生命卻是充滿多變和不確定性,我相信創意和想像力是當下最重要的才能之
			一。就讓我們打開更多對家庭教育的想像,把居所變成藝術場域,透過這本結集跟一群藝
			術家進行一場開放的創意實驗,為枯燥乏味甚至困難的境況帶來一點驚喜、生氣和希望!</p>

		<p>My gratitude to Rooftop Institute for inviting me to pen this preface for Event Scores by Artist-
			Parents. The pandemic has been here for over a year and as the mother of two, the wife of an
			artist, and the Lead Curator of Learning and Interpretation in M+, I have deep feelings about the
			subject. In the past year, all walks of life have given it their all to maintain ‘business as usual’ .
			Teachers and students have to overcome various difficulties to have online classes; parents or
			caregivers, whether they work from home or not, see problems coming one after another. At
			such a moment, I asked myself: what is the purpose of learning? What is the wisdom of the
			currently most needed ‘not suspending learning’ at home? I even question if art education still
			matters under the pandemic.</p>

		<p>Artists may not be the best students, but they are often the best learners: they are curious about
			the world, they observe things with an open mind and dare to ask questions, while refusing
			habitual thinking and responding to different challenges with creativity. Therefore, artists always
			have new realisation in their understanding of the world. At the same time, their capacity of
			self-understanding and self-affirmation naturally enhances their resistance against adversity.
			This reminds me of how Hui Po Keung described philosopher Heidegger’s views on learning
			and thinking in ‘Mobile Co-Learning’: he used carpenters as an example and pointed out that
			carpenters must understand the external and internal qualities of different types of wood to
			thoroughly reveal the best part of each unique piece. Similarly, real learning takes place through
			unconventional, constantly-updated thinking and an open mind to understand.</p>

		<p>This project was given birth by West Kowloon Cultural District Authority’s ‘Arts Relief Scheme
			2020’. Participating artists induce in their children’s daily experience with the creation model of
			‘instruction art’. Through everyday observations, they derive bizarre ideas and let participants
			freely interpret and re-interpret instructions. There is no singular standard answer. As the
			mother of two sons and the wife of the artist, I have noticed my husband is very good at breaking
			away from preset impressions and sentiments towards living and even learning. He also regards
			the limitations of his surroundings as opportunities to arouse children’s learning motivation and
			interest in ordinary life, from which he also learns together with them. Paradoxically, what seems
			to be restrictive instructions can actually break the various limitations of the current situation
			and open up other possibilities in life. This eventually enables us to realise that art is ubiquitous.
			I have known Rooftop Institute for a long time and I am particularly fond of their experimental
			art education projects. Among them, the ‘Hok Hok Zaap’ series resonates deeply with me. I still
			recall that not until I planned teaching activities for the M+ Museum did I discover that learning
			how to learn is more crucial than acquiring more knowledge. Especially as a parent, when I am
			busy, I tend to forget my passion for knowledge-seeking. I hope the museum will become an
			open platform for lifelong learning in the future, connecting a multitude of organisations that
			are passionate about education. Through the participation of people from different creative
			fields and backgrounds, everyone can learn with and from one another, achieving lifelong
			learning.</p>

		<p>The pandemic shall pass, yet life is still full of variables and uncertainties. I believe creativity
			and imagination are two of the most important talents at the moment. Let us open up further
			imagination of family education, turning our home into a space for art. This collection of open-
			minded and creative experiments of artists should bring a touch of surprise, vigour and hope to
			the boring and difficult circumstances!</p>
