		<p>2021 年 2 月完結後的第四天，收到了天台塾羅玉梅的電郵，邀請我為本書寫序。本來
			沒什麼心情和力氣接受新的任務，但盛情難卻，尤其是來自這麼認真於藝術教育的富德
			樓鄰居。翻了翻寄來的書稿，越讀越有興味，於是很快便回覆:「很喜歡這計劃。幾時要
			交稿？」</p>
		<p>喜歡這計劃，除了它所展現的教育理念，與我近年的思考十分接近外，還因為書中不少
			的圖片文字，都能引起我這個「又係教師又係父親」的情感共鳴。</p>

		<p>儘管編者強調:「我們不是要高舉藝術家作為家庭教育的專家或聖人」，而書名中也確實
			缺少了「又係教師」這個身份，但四十七位家長的「事件譜」，滿載甚至溢出的，顯然是
			生氣勃勃的共同學習經歷，這不就是傳說中的理想教育嗎？而啟動、引發、安排、促成
			這些「事件」的父母，難道不應該同時稱為教育工作者或教師？</p>

		<p>如果要用一種學術的語言描述這些「又係教育工作者」的藝術家父母，我首先想到的是
			洪席耶 (Jacques Rancière) 的「無知的教師」，其次是維果斯基 (Lev Vygotsky) 的「擁
			有激情的藝術家和環境組織者」。</p>

		<p>「無知」並非是罵人的貶語，而是真誠的同義。「湊女和返工很攰的爸媽」，以「不知道，
			你覺得呢？」來回應子女閱讀後的「這是甚麼？」的提問，只能是一種躲懶迴避的策略
			嗎？還是體現真誠地求知的對話？孩子們的「覺得」，確實是父母所「不知道」的;晚
			上專注於聆聽孩子同樣地專注的向月亮傾訴，每天自然都會獲得些新的理解和啟發，這
			不也是一種學習？</p>

		<p>於教育的場域，「擁有激情的藝術家和環境組織者」的一項主要任務，大概是創造和設計
			各種有助學習的遊戲，就像點草草、指甲賽跑、蔬菜花紙、尋蛋遊戲、與孩共舞、思考 隧道、樹葉印刷、紙上猜樓梯、縫紉時光機、電筒打死角、紙皮拼大船、隨機編排鍵盤、
			樹葉拼湊大象、創作「屋企音樂」、打造聲音劇場、hydro-dripping 渲染球鞋、尋找一模
			一樣的物件、用身體和照片環遊世界、孩子拖著帶上密封眼鏡的媽媽去冒險等等。根據
			維果斯基的理論，遊戲能夠為成長中的小孩提供一個超越現實的「最近發展區」(zone of
			proximal development)，在同儕或前輩協助下，於相對安全的環境和規則內，讓他們加
			速成長，自主地受教，包括接受共同認可的規範;而引伸洪席耶的思路，當父母和孩子
			都忘我地投進遊戲，自然能夠克服「分心」或「懶惰」，從專注中學習。</p>

		<p>讀本書書稿，智性的共鳴自然讓人痛快，但情感的互通更刻骨銘心。兩位又係父親又係
			藝術家寫給遠方子女的家書，「你過得怎麼樣？你怎樣應付？」的問題，「每日發一張相
			片」的要求，除了滿載思念，還蘊含祈求知悉 / 理解子女的熱切渴望，客觀上不也是在
			扮演「無知的教師 / 父母」的角色？相較循循善誘、叨叨教誨，這些「無知」卻「有情」
			的提問，是否更有助子女的成長？</p>

		<p>閱畢全書，印象最深的，是小女孩舉起寫滿 “Mama can you play with me” 的「示威」
			(還是「示愛」？)訴求的圖片，讓我記起兒子小時候要求我們與他一同玩耍的時刻:踢球、
			露營、尋寶、「三國無雙」/ FIFA / WII，以至願意耐心地教大人玩我們不太懂的 card
			games。可惜的是，當時的我，忙這忙那，總是容易「分心」或「懶惰」，有時甚至用種
			種理由，推搪兒子 play with me 的邀請，於是錯過了不少共同地專注當下的「事件」，
			及伴隨而至的學習機會。</p>

		<p>於是，我在想，如果當時能讀到這書稿⋯⋯</p>

		<p>On the fourth day after the end of February 2021, I received an email from Law Yuk Mui, co-
			founder of Rooftop Institute, inviting me to write this book’s preface. At first, I wasn’t in the
			mood or had the energy to accept new tasks. Such a warm-hearted invitation was, however, hard
			to turn down, especially when it came from a Foo Tak Building neighbour who is so serious about
			art education. I leafed through the manuscript posted to me. The more I read it, the more I found
			it interesting. So I promptly replied, ‘I like this project very much. When is the submission date?’</p>

		<p>My fondness for this project is not merely due to its education concept that is very similar to
			my thoughts in recent years, but also its many images and words that strike a chord with me, a
			teacher and father.</p>

		<p>Nevertheless, the editor emphasised, ‘We are not trying to elevate artists as family education
			experts or saints.’ Indeed, the role of a ‘teacher’ is absent from the book title. Yet, the ‘Event
			Scores’ of 47 parents are full of, or even overflowing with, evidently vibrant co-learning
			experiences. Isn’t this the ideal education that has been going around? And shouldn’t the
			parents who initiated, triggered, arranged, and contributed to these ‘events’ be called educators
			or teachers at the same time?</p>

		<p>If I must describe these artist-parents, who are also ‘educators’, in an academic language,
			the first thing came to mind was Jacques Rancière’s ‘ignorant schoolmaster’, followed by Lev
			Vygotsky’s ‘passionate artist and environment organiser’.</p>

		<p>‘Ignorant’ is not an abusive, derogatory term, but a synonym of ‘sincere’. Parents who are ‘tired
			from looking after daughters and working’ respond to their children’s post-reading question
			‘What is this?’ with ‘I don’t know. What do you think?’ Is it a strategy just to shirk? Or is it a
			dialogue that embodies a sincere search for knowledge? It is not parents' fault if they truly don't
			understand what children are thinking. In one of the examples, hearing a child's talk with the
			moon every night would be a good exercise to foster new understanding and inspiration. Isn't it
			also a kind of learning?</p>

		<p>In the scenario of education, the primary mission of a 'passionate artist' and 'environment
			organiser' is probably to create and design all kinds of games to facilitate learning, such as
			touch the shy grass, fingernail race, making organic blocked-print paper, egg hunt, dancing with
			children, tunnel of thoughts, leaf printing, rock-paper-scissors staircase battle on paper, sewing
			time machine, shooting dead corners with a torch, assembling a big ship with cardboard, random
			keyboard arrangement, piecing up an elephant with leaves, making house music, creating a
			sound theatre, dying trainers with hydro-dripping, looking for selfsame objects, travelling around
			the world with the body and photos, the great adventure of frame-changing game and so on.
			Reading the manuscript of this book, intellectual resonance is certainly delightful, but the
			emotional intercommunication is even more unforgettable. In the two family letters written by
			two artist-fathers to their children overseas, the questions ‘How are you? How do you cope with
			it?’ and the request of ‘sending a photo every day’, are not only full of yearnings, but also contain
			the eager desire for understanding of their children. Objectively, aren’t they also playing the role
			of ‘an ignorant schoolmaster/parent?’ Compared with patient and systematic guidance, are
			these ‘ignorant’ but ‘tender’ questions more helpful to the growth of children?</p>

		<p>After reading the whole book, the one who has made the deepest impression on me is the little
			girl holding up a piece of paper with ‘appeals’ (or ‘confession of love’?): ‘Mama can you play
			with me’. It reminds me of the moments my son asked us to play with him: to play football, to go
			camping, to do a treasure hunt, to play video games like Dynasty Warriors/FIFA/WII, and even to
			patiently teach us to play card games that we don’t know much about. It’s a pity that I was busy
			with various things and was always easily ‘distracted’ or became ‘lazy’. Sometimes, I even used
			different reasons to evade my son’s ‘play with me’ invitation. Thus, I have missed a lot of ‘events’
			to focus on the present moment together, as well as the derived learning opportunities.</p>

		<p>So, I am thinking, if I could read this book at that time...</p>
