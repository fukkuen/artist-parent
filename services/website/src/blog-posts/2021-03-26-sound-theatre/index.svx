讓孩子用智能手機去錄取家裡的各種自然形成的聲音，再
加上用小鼓棍敲擊那些不會發聲的物體的聲音，收集、歸
類之後，孩子和父母一起用其中多個聲音元素，串連成一
個在想像中的黑夜裡發生的故事。可以參考以前電台講故
事配音效的形式，不過在這個遊戲裡聲音是先導的，故事
是後來的。通過這個遊戲認識組成「家」的聲音要素，同
時通過黑暗裡的故事帶出家庭成員內心的夢想，這最終能
培養孩子的語言想像力和敘事能力。

Let your children use your smartphone to record various natural sounds
at home, in addition to tapping non-sound-generating objects with mini
drumsticks. After collecting and categorising them, parents and children
use some of the sound elements to string together an imaginary story
that happens in a dark night. You can refer to the storytelling-withfolely on the radio in the past. Yet, this is a sound-oriented game; the
story follows the sounds. Through this game, you can understand the
sound elements that make up a ‘home’. At the same time, it brings out
the dreams of the family members through the stories in the dark, which
can ultimately cultivate your children’s linguistic imagination and
narrative ability.
