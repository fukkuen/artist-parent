- introduction != summary from meta, but much longer, with styles (italic, colors, text-align-right)
- colors (orange, blue. bold..)
- text align center, paragraph
- separator (+ + + +)   
- image, float: left (across paragraph)
- quote
- youtube, video embedded
- ul li 
- image caption, link inside caption

if markup could add class, many styles could be achieved (color, alignment, floated image)
